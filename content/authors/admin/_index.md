I am a research and policy economist. I work for the Pontifical Catholic University of Peru. I have designed national policies, generated evidence for policymaking, and conducted research with significant media impact. Additionally, I have worked in the public sector in Peru, focusing on private sector development, labor, and education. At the Inter-American Development Bank, I supported research on labor and human capital issues and contributed to impact evaluation projects. Also, I ensured the quality of analytical reports and lending operations aimed at promoting inclusive green growth at the World Bank.
